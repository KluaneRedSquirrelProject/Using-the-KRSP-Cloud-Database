1.	Download MySQL Workbench
2.	Upon opening SQL Workbench, click (+) next to My SQL Connections to add a new connection. This will be different from the local connection you may already be using for the KRSP database you have saved on your hard drive in previous years.
3.	When the popup appears enter the following:
          Connection name: krsp-aws
          Hostname: krsp.cepb5cjvqban.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com
          Port: 3306
          Username: the name assigned to you by the database administrator when your user account was set up
          Password: the default password assigned to you by the database administrator. You will likely have received instructions that this will expire and should be changed immediately – you will change it in the next step
4.	Click the “OK” button in the lower right. 
          If your password has expired, you will get a popup window saying “Failed to connect….”:
5.  Click OK
6.	A new popup will say “Password for MySQL account ‘username’@’hostname’ expired. Please pick a new password:”
          Enter your old password (the one assigned to you) and then enter a (GOOD, SECURE) new password.
